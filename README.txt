Drupal Ubercart payment provider for ING iDEAL Advanced, Rabobank iDEAL Professional and ABN iDEAL Zelfbouw.

This module has been written from the ground up and does currently NOT provide a migration path from earlier (i.e. 1.x) versions. Furthermore this module has currently only been tested against ideal-simulator.nl and ING's test environment.

Installation:
- Move the 'ssl' directory outside your wwwroot.
- Copy your certificate and private key into this 'ssl' directory.
- Enable the module and configure it on the Ubercart payment method settings page.
